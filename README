It's Yucky Charms, y'all!

A javascript physics based game about eating Lucky Charms.
THE javascript physics-based game about eating Lucky Charms.

This is my first attempt at making a whole project in js so the code is
a great small mess. But there's not that much of it!
But there's also around 0 comments and a ton that's not used that should be
commented out...

Anyways, the project is built off of this tutorial:
http://www.luxanimals.com/blog/article/combining_easel_box2d
so not surprisingly combines easel.js and box2dweb

All of my code lives in demo.js

Please fork, comment, and teach me! I come from an ActionScript background, and
I have NO idea what I'm doing in this crazy world of javascript particularly
when it comes to scope and object creation and prototyping. So you'll see
things like the actorObject which is defined within the box2d var and then
other objects like monster and MonsterComic which are defined outside.

Why is that? I don't know. Hopefully you do!

For more explanation, conversation, etc. check the blog where hopefully
some more technical posts are forthcoming:

This might not be a super helpful README, but it's something and this is my first
open-source github project, and hey, social coding!
