    <h3>A Brief Explanation</h3>
    <p>
        I grew up eating every possible sugar cereal. From the old standby Froot
        Loops to the rare editions of Cap'n'Crunch's Oops! All Berries,
        we had them all at my house. Chip, the burgling dog Cookie Crisp asked
        from my TV, "COOKIES? For BREAKFAST?" And I could answer proudly,
        "Yes, old friend. But only when we're out of Rice Krispies Treats Cereal."
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there was one cereal that was forbidden in my household: Lucky Charms.
        My parents drew the line at fake marshmallows, and so Lucky
        the Leprechaun, like pork and shellfish, was banned from the pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, my friend Alex ALWAYS had Lucky Charms at his house. The
        morning after sleep-overs, a bowl of the good stuff was always in
        order. This game is about those bowls.
    </p>
    
    <ul> <i>Instructions:</i>
        <li>Mouse down to move stuff about with your spoon.</li>
        <li>Click a cereal bit to eat it and everything it's glommed on to</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br/><br/><br/><br/>
    <h3>What Else?</h3>
    <p>
        This is the first game that I made by myself.
        I'm incredibly fortunate to have had food on my table throughout
        my entire life. My easy-going relationship with food is what allowed me
        to make Yucky Charms.
    </p>
    
    <p>
       Hopefully, you too can play with your food-
       you can save all the marshmallows for the end of the bowl,
       separate m&m's by color before eating,
       and chew around the middle of carrots.
       Unfortunately, that's not nearly always the case in America
       where hunger still exists for 1 in 6 Americans (THAT'S 49 MILLION PEOPLE). 
    </p>

        Donating to this food drive will help solve a real problem for real families.
        If you have the means to do so, I hope you help out.<br/>

        <br/>
        The core tech is based off of

            this tutorial
        </a>
         combining <a href=http://www.createjs.com/#!/EaselJS target="_blank">easel.js</a> and

         Oh, and be sure to get (and clean up) the source 
         <a href=https://github.com/SamPotasz/yuckyCharms target="_blank">
            on Github,
         </a>
         because I have no idea what I'm doing in javascript.
