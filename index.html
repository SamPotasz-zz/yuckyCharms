    <h3>A Brief Explanation</h3>
    <p>
        I grew up eating every possible sugar cereal. From the old standby Froot
        Loops to the rare editions of Cap'n'Crunch's Oops! All Berries,
        we had them all at my house. Chip, the burgling dog Cookie Crisp asked
        from my TV, "COOKIES? For BREAKFAST?" And I could answer proudly,
        "Yes, old friend. But only when we're out of Rice Krispies Treats Cereal."
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there was one cereal that was forbidden in my household: Lucky Charms.
        My parents drew the line at fake marshmallows, and so Lucky
        the Leprechaun, like pork and shellfish, was banned from the pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, my friend Alex ALWAYS had Lucky Charms at his house. The
        morning after sleep-overs, a bowl of the good stuff was always in
        order. This game is about those bowls.

        <a href="http://codesmores.wordpress.com/category/yucky-charms/">my blog</a>.
        <br/>
        The core tech is based off of
        <a href=http://www.luxanimals.com/blog/article/combining_easel_box2d target="_blank">
            this tutorial
        </a>
         combining <a href=http://www.createjs.com/#!/EaselJS target="_blank">easel.js</a> and
         <a href=http://code.google.com/p/box2dweb target="_blank">box2dweb</a>.
         <br/>
         Oh, and be sure to get (and clean up) the source 
         <a href=https://github.com/SamPotasz/yuckyCharms target="_blank">
            on Github,
         </a>
         because I have no idea what I'm doing in javascript.
